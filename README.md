# New York Food Desert Analysis
In this capstone project, our team analyzed food deserts in New York, focusing on areas with limited access to affordable and nutritious food. We combined data from SNAP benefits distribution and geographic food access data to uncover disparities and highlight regions in need of targeted interventions.

The goal was to develop a centralized data pipeline and visual dashboard to help policymakers, community leaders, and advocacy groups make data-driven decisions to improve food accessibility across New York.

# Project Phases & Key Deliverables
1️⃣ Data Collection & Storage

    Collected datasets related to food access, population demographics, and SNAP distribution.
    Stored data securely in Escel and MSSQL hosted on AWS.

2️⃣ ETL Pipeline Development

    Built automated ETL pipelines using SSIS to:
        Extract raw data from source files.
        Clean, transform, and standardize data fields.
        Load data into structured tables within MSSQL.

3️⃣ Database Design & Schema Creation

    Developed a data flow diagram to map how data moves through the system, from ingestion to reporting.
    Created a use case diagram to capture user interactions with the system, ensuring alignment with stakeholder needs.
    Designed an entity-relationship diagram (ERD) to model tables, relationships, and key attributes, forming the foundation for the relational database.
    Built a sequence diagram to document the order of processes within the ETL pipeline, ensuring a clear understanding of data transformations and system operations.

4️⃣ Data Analysis & Reporting

    Analyzed key metrics like:
        Population with low access to grocery stores.
        Distribution of SNAP benefits by region.
        Correlation between income level and food access.

5️⃣ Data Visualization

    Developed interactive dashboards in Tableau to:
        Map food deserts by census tracts.
        Highlight areas with the highest food insecurity.
        Compare SNAP benefit usage rates across regions.
    Dashboards were designed for policy presentations and community outreach.

6️⃣ Presentation & Stakeholder Delivery

    Created a comprehensive presentation using Canva, summarizing:
        Key insights.
        Recommendations for policy changes.
        Visual dashboards and findings.
    Delivered presentation during a final capstone showcase with faculty and industry reviewers.
